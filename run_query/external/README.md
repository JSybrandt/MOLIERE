External Files:
===============

This is the place we keep links to external libraries.
At the moment, we need [networkit](https://github.com/kit-parco/networkit) which needs to be built as a shared library.

(If you are at clemson, I have already set this up for you)

We also need PLDA, which has been provided in full.
We made a minor modification to the build process so that it works properly with palmetto resources.
The main makefile will take care of this.
