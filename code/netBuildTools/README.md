CREATE NETWORK FROM ABSTRACT FILE
=================================

In this project I am going to read in
abstract.txt and canon.vec in order to
do a number of things simoultaneously.

Firstly, I am going to run FLANN
Secondly, I am going to collect keyword
information to do tf-idf
At the end I'm going to output a huge edge list
as well as a node-name file.

Format:
-------

I think I'm going to output a space-separated edge list
starting with 1 as the first ID
